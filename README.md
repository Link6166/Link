2.  Lost After Delivery
Hi $contacts.name.first,

OPTION 1 - Signed for (all items)

I sincerely apologize to learn that you have not received your package. I've tracked the package, and our records show that it was delivered and signed for. You can check the tracking information provided by our carrier by clicking here: [Insert link]. Please check with other members of your household, neighbors, or anyone else who may have accepted the delivery and may have the package in their possession. Otherwise, please contact your carrier or dispute the charges with your financial institution.

OPTION 2 - Not signed for (high fraud item)

I'm sorry you haven't received your item. I'm aware you didn't receive it, but it turns out that our records show this package was delivered, so due to the nature of the missing item, we will need to investigate before we can issue a refund or a replacement.

In order to facilitate this process, please file a police report and email a copy to executiveescalations@walmart.com. Please include your order number and contact information when sending the police report to us. Once we receive your police report, our escalation team should respond within 7 business days.

OPTION 3 - not signed for (regular item)

I certainly apologize you haven't received your item. Please let us know whether you'd like us to send a replacement for your item or if you want a refund. If you select replacement, please be advised that replacement orders must be for the same item, and if in case the item is no longer available, a refund will automatically be issued to the original form of payment. Refunds will process to the original form of payment within 7 days of initiating the refund.   

[***ONLY IF ITEM IS OVER $7***]  If you happen to receive your original item after we've issued a refund or replacement, please email us again. At that time, we could have the item picked up, or if you would like to keep the item, we could arrange to bill you again with your permission.  

Sincerely,

3. Lost in Transit or no movement


Hi $contacts.name.first,

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. We certainly apologize that you have not received your item/order yet.

I have tracked your order, and there is no movement on the package at this time. Sometimes this means that the package has been misplaced, but most of the time the package is still on the way but simply has not been scanned at its last location.  


OPTION 1 - EDD today or in the future
Most packages arrive on time, even if they are missing tracking information. Because the estimated delivery date has not passed, we advise you to wait until the end of day on [***INSERT EDD**] to see if the package arrives. If it hasn't arrived by the end of the day on [***INSERT EDD***], please allow three additional days to see if the package is simply running a bit late. If the package does not arrive by that time or you are unable to wait the three additional days, contact us and let us know if you would like a refund or replacement.

If you select replacement at that time, please be advised that replacement orders must be for the same item, and if in case the item is no longer available, a refund will automatically be issued to the original form of payment.  Refunds will process to the original form of payment within 7 days of initiating the refund. Once you inform us of your preference, we will provide instructions on returning the item you currently have.  

OPTION 2 - EDD in the past (less than 3 days past EDD)
Because most packages eventually arrive, even if they are a few days late, we'd like to ask if you are able to wait an additional 3 days to see if the original package arrives. If you do not wish to wait, please let us know if you prefer a refund or a replacement.

If you select replacement at that time, please be advised that replacement orders must be for the same item, and if in case the item is no longer available, a refund will automatically be issued to the original form of payment. Refunds will process to the original form of payment within 7 days of initiating the refund. Once you inform us of your preference, we will provide instructions on returning the item you currently have.  

OPTION 3 - EDD in the past (more than 3 days past EDD)
However, because your estimated delivery date has passed, we can process a refund or a replacement for your item. Which would you prefer?

If you select replacement, please be advised that replacement orders must be for the same item, and if in case the item is no longer available, a refund will automatically be issued to the original form of payment. Refunds will process to the original form of payment within 7 days of initiating the refund. Once you inform us of your preference, we will provide instructions on returning the item you currently have.

I have issued a request through USPS to pick up your item. You will receive an email from USPS with the subject "USPS - Package Pickup Complete" which will include pickup details.

8. Authorization hold

Hi $contacts.name.first,

[***DOES NOT APPLY FOR ORDERS PLACED WITH PAYPAL OR GIFT CARDS***]

Allow me inform you that you were not charged for this order. As matter of fact, the charge you see on your account is an authorization hold.

Any time you place an order, an authorization hold is placed on your method of payment for the total amount of the order. This authorization hold is not an actual charge. It just confirms that there are funds available to complete your purchase, and it typically appears in your account as a pending charge. The actual charge for the purchase amount does not occur until your order is shipped.

If an order cancels, an auth reversal is automatically generated and sent from our system to the financial institution's system. The auth is then usually dropped with 3 days; however, it is up to the issuing banks technology/system as to when the authorization actually gets reversed (out of Walmart's control). The best way to get the authorization hold removed early is to contact your financial institution.

For more information about authorization holds please visit the link below:

I have submitted an intent to cancel on your order and will try our best to complete the cancellation process at your request. Please be advised that cancellations are not guaranteed because we do try to process orders as swiftly as possible. You will receive notification via email within the next 48 hours. If your order is successfully cancelled within that time, you will receive a confirmation of the cancellation.  If the cancellation request does not reach our fulfillment center before your order is processed, your order will ship, and you will receive a shipment confirmation email. [***ONLY IF INTENT TO CANCEL PLACED DUE TO WRONG ADDRESS***] In that case, we can try to intercept the package if it's not too far along in the shipping process, but we can't redirect the package to a different address.

OPTION 2 (you were unable to place intent to cancel):

Because we process orders as quickly as possible, your order is already in the shipping process and cannot be canceled at this time.

To attempt to intercept, please call us immediately at [***Insert Number***]. [***INTENT TO CANCEL PLACED FOR REASONS OTHER THAN WRONG ADDRESS***]  Because we are unable to cancel your order, you may return the items in your local store to receive a refund [***UNLESS IT IS AN ITEM THAT IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR STORE RETURN***] or contact us again to organize a return by mail.

OPTION 3 (S2S order that has shipped):
Once a Site to Store order is on its way to the store, it's not possible for us to cancel or refund it. However, there are two simple ways to receive a refund.

Get a refund at the store:
Once the order arrives at the store for pickup, you can go to the Site to Store counter and request a full refund.

Don't pick up the order:

19. Customer wants to know why canceled


Hi $contacts.name.first,

We certainly apologize that your order was cancelled. Allow me explain why your order could not b completed.

OPTION 1 -(Failed Fraud Checks (including edelivery orders like egift cards or prepaid phone cards that failed fraud checks)
We have many security checks in place to help prevent unauthorized use of your credit or debit card. We take your security very seriously, and it appears that at this time your method of payment did not pass all of our checks. We cannot accept your online order at this time, but you may purchase this product at any Walmart store if it is available. You have the ability to search all nearby stores using our Store Finder

OPTION 2 (ONLY if meets requirements in ASC: Why Canceled Customer Insult)
We have many security checks in place to help prevent unauthorized use of your credit or debit card. We take your security very seriously, and it appears that at this time your method of payment did not pass all of our checks during processing. In order to assist you in this matter, we have opened a case to review your account to determine if these security checks canceled your order in error. Please try to place your order again after 30 minutes have passed using the same Walmart.com account and computer. While it's not guaranteed that your order will be successful, this will ensure that we have enough time to review your account.

OPTION 3 (Failed finance verification/payment failed):
It appears that there was an issue verifying all the billing information related to this order. This type of cancellation usually occurs because the billing information (e.g. address, expiration date, card number) on file with us did not match the information on your credit card statement. Please contact your financial institution to verify that the payment details you are using are correct. In the meantime, you may also place your order using a different method of payment.

OPTION 4  (Out of stock)
It appears that this item is not currently in stock.  At this time we are unable to estimate when this item will be back in stock. Please visit the site periodically to see if the item is back in stock. Some items display a “Get in-stock alert" button. If available, please use this feature so that we can notify you via email when the item is available again.

You can also visit your local Walmart store to see if they have the item in stock. Store customer service can also check into the availability of an item in the stores in your area.  You can reach us there by dialing 1-800-WALMART (1-800-925-6278) and selecting option 2 and then option 2 again.

[ORDER PLACED ON CREDIT/DEBIT CARD]
Because your order was canceled, your bank will remove the authorization hold on your card. While most authorization holds drop within 3 days, it can take longer, depending on your bank/credit card company. The bank ultimately controls when this charge is released, so the best way to get the authorization hold removed early is for you to contact your financial institution.

[ORDER PLACED USING PAYPAL]
Because your order was canceled, you will be refunded for this order. The refund will post to your original method of payment within 7 days.  If you have questions about your refund, please contact your financial institution.

[ORDER PLACED WITH GIFT CARD]
Because your order was canceled, you will be refunded for this order. The refund should post back to your gift card within the next 7 days.
