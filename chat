Delivery Issues
Lost After Delivery 

Hi $contacts.name.first,

OPTION 1 - Signed for (all items)

I sincerely apologize to learn that you have not received your package. I've tracked the package, and our records show that it was delivered and signed for. You can check the tracking information provided by our carrier by clicking here: [Insert link]. Please check with other members of your household, neighbors, or anyone else who may have accepted the delivery and may have the package in their possession. Otherwise, please contact your carrier or dispute the charges with your financial institution.

OPTION 2 - Not signed for (high fraud item)

We certainly apologize that you have not received your item. We are indeed  aware you didn't receive it, but it turns out that our records show this package was delivered, so due to the nature of the missing item, we will need to investigate before we can issue a refund or a replacement.

In order to facilitate this process, please file a police report and email a copy to executiveescalations@walmart.com. Please include your order number and contact information when sending the police report to us. Once we receive your police report, our escalation team should respond within 7 business days.

OPTION 3 - not signed for (regular item)

I certainly apologize you haven't received your item. Please let us know whether you'd like us to send a replacement for your item or if you want a refund. If you select replacement, please be advised that replacement orders must be for the same item, and if in case the item is no longer available, a refund will automatically be issued to the original form of payment. Refunds will process to the original form of payment within 7 days of initiating the refund.

[ONLY IF ITEM IS OVER $7] If you happen to receive your original item after we've issued a refund or replacement, please email us again. At that time, we could have the item picked up, or if you would like to keep the item, we could arrange to bill you again with your permission.

Sincerely,

Lost in Transit or no movement

Hi $contacts.name.first,

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. We certainly apologize that you have not received your order yet.

Thank you for your patience. I have tracked your order, and there is no movement on the package at this time. Sometimes this means that the package has been misplaced, but most of the time the package is still on the way but simply has not been scanned at its last location.

OPTION 1 - EDD today or in the future 

Most packages arrive on time, even if they are missing tracking information. Because the estimated delivery date has not passed, we advise you to wait until the end of day on [**INSERT EDD] to see if the package arrives. If it hasn't arrived by the end of the day on [INSERT EDD*], please allow three additional days to see if the package is simply running a bit late. If the package does not arrive by that time or you are unable to wait the three additional days, contact us and let us know if you would like a refund or replacement.

If you select replacement at that time, please be advised that replacement orders must be for the same item, and if in case the item is no longer available, a refund will automatically be issued to the original form of payment. Refunds will process to the original form of payment within 7 days of initiating the refund. 

OPTION 2 - EDD in the past (less than 3 days past EDD) 

Because most packages eventually arrive, even if they are a few days late, we'd like to ask if you are able to wait an additional 3 days to see if the original package arrives. If you do not wish to wait, please let us know if you prefer a refund or a replacement.

If you select replacement at that time, please be advised that replacement orders must be for the same item, and if in case the item is no longer available, a refund will automatically be issued to the original form of payment. Refunds will process to the original form of payment within 7 days of initiating the refund. 

OPTION 3 - EDD in the past (more than 3 days past EDD)

However, because your estimated delivery date has passed, we can process a refund or a replacement for your item. Which would you prefer?

If you select replacement, please be advised that replacement orders must be for the same item, and if in case the item is no longer available, a refund will automatically be issued to the original form of payment. Refunds will process to the original form of payment within 7 days of initiating the refund.

Incorrect Item, site

Hi $contacts.name.first,
 
I certainly apologize the inconvenience caused with the incorrect color of the dvd player that you received. However, in all honesty, after reviewing our website with this item details, I found that there might be an issue with this item page indicating purple color but with an incorrect picture. This might be cause due to an incorrect item label and that is why you received one from another color from the one you ordered. 

In this case, we can issue a refund or a replacement but if we issue a replacement there is a possibility that you will receive an incorrect color again. 

We can offer you in this case that we issue a refund so you can return this item and you may reorder another similar item in purple color and we will issue a 20% discount to rectify this inconvenience. Please let us know how to proceed.

We certainly understand your concern regarding the refund that you have not received for a cancelled order. Allow me inform you that you were not charged for this order. As matter of fact, the charge you see on your account is an authorization hold.

Allow me explain in further detail. 
Any time you place an order, an authorization hold is placed on your method of payment for the total amount of the order. This authorization hold is not an actual charge. It just confirms that there are funds available to complete your purchase, and it typically appears in your account as a pending charge. The actual charge for the purchase amount does not occur until your order is shipped.

If an order cancels, an authorization reversal is automatically generated and sent from our system to the financial institution's system. The authorization hold is then usually dropped with 3 days; however, it is up to the issuing banks technology/system as to when the authorization actually gets reversed (out of Walmart's control). The best way to get the authorization hold removed early is to contact your financial institution.

For more information about authorization holds please visit the link below:

Cancellation Related
Customer wants to cancel

Hi $contacts.name.first,

OPTION 1 (you placed intent to cancel):

I have submitted an intent to cancel on your order and will try our best to complete the cancellation process at your request. Please be advised that cancellations are not guaranteed because we do try to process orders as swiftly as possible. You will receive notification via email within the next 48 hours. If your order is successfully cancelled within that time, you will receive a confirmation of the cancellation. If the cancellation request does not reach our fulfillment center before your order is processed, your order will ship, and you will receive a shipment confirmation email. 

[ONLY IF INTENT TO CANCEL PLACED DUE TO WRONG ADDRESS] In that case, we can try to intercept the package if it's not too far along in the shipping process, but we can't redirect the package to a different address. To attempt to intercept, please call us immediately at [Insert Number]. 

[IF INTENT TO CANCEL WAS NOT PLACED DUE TO WRONG ADDRESS] In that case, you may return your order in store for a refund or contact us again to arrange a return by mail.

OPTION 2 (you were unable to place intent to cancel):

Because we process orders as quickly as possible, your order is already in the shipping process and cannot be canceled at this time. 

[ONLY IF INTENT TO CANCEL PLACED DUE TO WRONG ADDRESS] Because we are unable to cancel your order, we can try to intercept the package if it's not too far along in the shipping process, but we can't redirect the package to a different address. To attempt to intercept, please call us immediately at [Insert Number].

 [INTENT TO CANCEL PLACED FOR REASONS OTHER THAN WRONG ADDRESS] Because we are unable to cancel your order, you may return the items in your local store to receive a refund [UNLESS IT IS AN ITEM THAT IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR STORE RETURN] or contact us again to organize a return by mail.

OPTION 3 (S2S order that has shipped): Once a Site to Store order is on its way to the store, it's not possible for us to cancel or refund it. However, there are two simple ways to receive a refund.

Get a refund at the store: Once the order arrives at the store for pickup, you can go to the Site to Store counter and request a full refund.

Don't pick up the order: Any item that isn't picked up within 14 days of arrival will be canceled and refunded.

OPTION 3 (Failed finance verification/payment failed): 

It appears that there was an issue verifying all the billing information related to this order. This type of cancellation usually occurs because the billing information (e.g. address, expiration date, card number) on file with us did not match the information on your credit card statement. Please contact your financial institution to verify that the payment details you are using are correct. In the meantime, you may also place your order using a different method of payment.

Cancel international

Hi $contacts.name.first,
 
I certainly apologize that your order was cancelled. After further reviewing your account and cancelled order, this is what I found. Since you just created your account, this was your first order with us and due to the amount of the order, our security systems to prevent unauthorized use of credit/debit cards cancelled your order.

In this case we kindly advise you to wait 48 hours and try to place a new order, however, since you are using an international credit card, that also may cause that orders get cancelled more often since they require additional security checks.

Hi $contacts.name.first,
 
We certainly apologize that you have not been notified to pick up your orders yet. Allow me inform that I have carefully gone through our records and have determined that your orders did not process properly. I'm sorry to say we were not able to process your ordesr due to a problem with our system. Because this order was not going to be processed successfully. In this case for the fastest resolution we kindly suggest you to contact the store directly at (734) 286-9594 to verify the status of your orders. If the store confirms you that your order cannot be processed, you may request that your orders are cancelled. 

Regarding your payment for these orders, once your orders are cancelled, your bank will remove the authorization hold on your card. While most authorization holds drop within 3 days, it can take longer, depending on your bank/credit card company. The bank ultimately controls when this charge is released, so the best way to get the authorization hold removed early is for you to contact your financial institution.
